archive at dsource.org/projects/gtkd.

If you want to tweak the automatic wrapper or help with it, use git...
https://github.com/gtkd-developers/GtkD

Installation:
-------------
The installation depends on the setup of your development environment.
This means that to release your project you must include the gtkD lib
on your deliverable or statically link to gtkD - please pay attention
to the license.

Compile the lib and the test programs:
--------------------------------------

Linux / Posix:
--------------
Using the GNU make to compile GtkD on these Operating systems, calling make
with no options will build GtkD, GtkD-Sourceview and one of the demos.
Optionaly these options are available:
 * all             = build everything.
 * [shared-]gtkd   = build gtkd.
 * [shared-]gtkdsv = build gtkd-sourceview.
 * [shared-]gda    = build gda.
 * [shared-]gstreamer = build gstreamer.
 * shared          = build gtkd and gtkd-sourceview as shared libraries.
                     This currently only works with LDC.
 * install and uninstall options are also available for the options
   mentioned above.

Or you can use one of the build options also available for Windows.

Windows:
--------
You can build GtkD using build/bud http://www.dsource.org/projects/build
see the README in the build directory.

If you are using D1 dsss is also an option see the README_DSSS for more
information.
