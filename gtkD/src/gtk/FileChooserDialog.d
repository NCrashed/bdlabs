/**
 * GtkFileChooserDialog is a dialog box suitable for use with
 * "File/Open" or "File/Save as" commands. This widget works by
 * putting a GtkFileChooserWidget inside a GtkDialog. It exposes
 * the GtkFileChooser interface, so you can use all of the
 * GtkFileChooser functions on the file chooser dialog as well as
 * those for GtkDialog.
 *
 * Note that GtkFileChooserDialog does not have any methods of its
 * own. Instead, you should use the functions that work on a
 * GtkFileChooser.
 *
 * $(DDOC_COMMENT example)
 *
 * $(DDOC_COMMENT example)
 *
 * To use a dialog for saving, you can use this:
 *
 * $(DDOC_COMMENT example)
 *
 * Setting up a file chooser dialog
 *
 * There are various cases in which you may need to use a GtkFileChooserDialog:
 *
 * To select a file for opening, as for a
 *  File/Open command. Use
 *  GTK_FILE_CHOOSER_ACTION_OPEN.
 *
 * To save a file for the first time, as for a
 *  File/Save command. Use
 *  GTK_FILE_CHOOSER_ACTION_SAVE, and suggest a name such as
 *  "Untitled" with gtk_file_chooser_set_current_name().
 *
 * To save a file under a different name, as for a
 *  File/Save As command. Use
 *  GTK_FILE_CHOOSER_ACTION_SAVE, and set the existing filename
 *  with gtk_file_chooser_set_filename().
 *
 * To choose a folder instead of a file. Use
 *  GTK_FILE_CHOOSER_ACTION_SELECT_FOLDER.
 *
 * Note
 *
 * Old versions of the file chooser's documentation suggested
 * using gtk_file_chooser_set_current_folder() in various
 * situations, with the intention of letting the application
 * suggest a reasonable default folder. This is no longer
 * considered to be a good policy, as now the file chooser is
 * able to make good suggestions on its own. In general, you
 * should only cause the file chooser to show a specific folder
 * when it is appropriate to use gtk_file_chooser_set_filename(),
 * i.e. when you are doing a File/Save
 * As command and you already
 * have a file saved somewhere.
 *
 * Response Codes
 *
 * GtkFileChooserDialog inherits from GtkDialog, so buttons that
 * go in its action area have response codes such as
 * GTK_RESPONSE_ACCEPT and GTK_RESPONSE_CANCEL. For example, you
 * could call gtk_file_chooser_dialog_new() as follows:
 *
 * $(DDOC_COMMENT example)
 *
 * This will create buttons for "Cancel" and "Open" that use stock
 * response identifiers from GtkResponseType. For most dialog
 * boxes you can use your own custom response codes rather than the
 * ones in GtkResponseType, but GtkFileChooserDialog assumes that
 * its "accept"-type action, e.g. an "Open" or "Save" button,
 * will have one of the following response
 * codes:
 *
 * GTK_RESPONSE_ACCEPT
 * GTK_RESPONSE_OK
 * GTK_RESPONSE_YES
 * GTK_RESPONSE_APPLY
 *
 * This is because GtkFileChooserDialog must intercept responses
 * and switch to folders if appropriate, rather than letting the
 * dialog terminate â€” the implementation uses these known
 * response codes to know which responses can be blocked if
 * appropriate.
 *
 * Note
 *
 * To summarize, make sure you use a
 * stock response code
 * when you use GtkFileChooserDialog to ensure proper operation.
